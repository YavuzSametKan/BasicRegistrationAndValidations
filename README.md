# User Registration and Validation System

## Overview

This project is a Java-based user registration and validation system designed to ensure that user information meets specific criteria before registration. The system validates various user attributes like username, password, email, name, surname, and age to ensure they adhere to predefined validation rules. If any of the criteria are not met, the system provides detailed error messages.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can register with a username, password, email, name, surname, age, and gender.
- **Validation:** Each user attribute undergoes strict validation to ensure it meets the required format and conditions.
- **Error Reporting:** If a validation rule is violated, the system returns a detailed error message for each issue.
